        <div class="subheading mb-5">SingerðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I started out as a very small singer, my average listeners were barely over 20. I have the ambition that I want to perform on stage, but at the time it looked like the dream was so far away that it feels like its impossible to reach.
          I was also poor at the time, I just started my life out here in society, so in order to chase this dream I had to work several part time job in order to sustain myself, any extra money I have left after I calculated my rent, tax, student loans and my daily expenses, I would spend that on music.
          I would practice a lot of songs, studying their lyrics and melodies, all in order to release my own songs. I tried sharing pieces of my voices on social media, short videos of me singing and covering other songs, and it sloely helped me gain some followers. I was happy that the method worked at the time, but a year later, I realized that that wasn't enough.
          That the progress I'm making right now will never get me on stage performing live because I'm simply still too small. I was lying on my bed one night, and saw a shooting star flew by, and I wished for that this will go well.<br><br>

          Then I applied for multiple music companies in order to help my growth, I tried to show them that I know how to do a little bit of everything, and that I really need a bigger audience. I was rejected over and over again because they kept telling me that I am the Jack of all trades, but a Master of none.
          I told myself that I don't need them, and I could do this on my own, but after testing out several new ideas, it didn't get me the progress I was hoping to achieve. I started getting tired and thought about giving up on the dream, but my ambition was too strong, I wanted to sing on stage! I applied to some music companies for a second time, hoping for a different result this time.
          And to my luck, one company decided to give me a chance. I made my debut as a guest appearance on another singer's performance, she had a nice voice. When it's finally my turn to sing by myself on stage, when she was taking a break. I took a deep breath and started my first time singing on stage.
          People cheered for me, surprised that the guest could sing as well as the main singer, and as they cheered, that was the moment I decided that I want to do this forever.<br><br>

          However, after joining that company, I found out that they didn't have enough funds to support my career, because the program was designed to supprt the main singer from the other day only, since it was a rash decision on letting me join, they didn't have any extra for me. So nothing has changed except getting a little more exposure than before.
          I was already getting tired, the part time jobs weren't helping me much and I realized that I can't keep this up anymore. I told the manager that I might just give up because I'm financially unstable.... untilmy manager told me that I have gained followers exponentially while I'm sulking and was about to give up, and with the money they gained from those extra followers, they finally have the money to start supporting me.
          I felt overwhelmed, how the wish I made towards the shooting star was able to save me from giving up every time I was about to give up. I started writing a new song, and submitted it, with their fundings I was able to get the song done in no time. I was so eager to drop it, because I know my fans were waiting. And since then, after I dropped that song, it has became my most represented work.
          I dropped two albums, and had 3 of my own live concert performances. I will keep making more music and try different styles and genres, I will continue to have more concerts for old and new fans to watch, but no matter how hard I work, the day that I dropped that song will always be the moment of I made it.
